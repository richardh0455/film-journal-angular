# Film Journal - Angular
This is an Angular Webapp for journaling my photography experiments - Each shot has an Aperture and Shutter speed setting, and each roll of film has an ISO setting that determines the exposure of the film. Cameras can also have different lenses, 
and there can be different lighting effects for different times of the day. All of this is recorded in a Firebase NoSQL database, via an API (see https://github.com/richardh0455/film-journal-api) 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
